Question:-How do you read body more then one time?
Answer:-By using response.bufferEntity()

Question:-Why bufferEntity() method came into picture?
Answer:-when we read response body directly by using readEntity(),
        then we can read only once so if we try to read second time
        then InputStream will close that's why we can not read more
        then once.
             If we want to read response body more then once then we should
        use bufferEntity().
             After that we can read response body any number of time.
        That's why bufferEntity() came into picture.
